=============================

Scripts and things for OpenMPI build on NVIDIA Jetson TK1

CPU and GPU Overrides to turn on and off CPU cores, other scripts set the GPU Clock. Warning all of this is at your own work, assuming you
have a NVIDIA Jetson TK1 with Grinch kernel.

These files should get you setup for building OpenMPI and several other specialized items from source.
